## Introduction

Line follower robots are used in semi as well as fully autonomous plants. The line follower is a self-operating robot that detects and follows a line that is drawn. The path consists of a black line on a white surface. The sensors that can be used are typically LED/LDR, LED/Photodiode or LED/Phototransistor pairs.
